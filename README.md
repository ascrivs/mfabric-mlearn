# Notes for MS Learn AI Challenge

## Summary

These are my notes following the path of a Microsoft Fabric Data Engineer. I have completed a Udemy course along with a Day In the Life of an Analyst by Pragmatic works so I hope this is supplemental. 

I will keep this public if they help anyone else in their path to continued education.
